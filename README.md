PythonClock
===========


My first python project is a personalized world clock system. 
This has been implemented with the help of coursera.org as a part of their Learn To Code programme.

Finally, the clock starts ticking!

1. Download and install latest python (3.x version) from http://www.python.org/download/ .
2. Extract the attached files in a single directory.
3. Then Run the file a1_gui.py.
4. Have fun!

NOTE: Make sure you run the file on Python 3.x version.
